In today’s world,  the  trash  cans  placed  in  the cities are jam-packed due to the increase in the waste. A lot of stinking and sewage problems causes bad hygienic conditions and leads to deadly diseases &amp; human illness. To avoid these, we have designed a “Smart Trash Can Monitoring System” where it can overcome this in an innovative and efficient way. This  idea  can  be  implemented  for  Smart  Buildings,  Cities, Colleges,  Hospitals,  Public  spots  and  Bus  stands.  Each  trash can contain a smart device for level detection of thetrash can which  transmits  the  garbage/trash  level  with  its  token  ID, accessed  by  the  concerned  municipal/regional  authorities through  the  mobile  app,  so  that  they  can  take  immediate actions  to  clean  the  trash  can  once  it  gets  filled.  The  device consists of an Ultra Sonic Sensor, Arduino Uno, GPS and Wi-Fi module.
